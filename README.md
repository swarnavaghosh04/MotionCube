# MotionCube #

This software is able to read data from the MPU6050 and render a 3D cube rotated to the orientation of the device.

The following libraries are required in order to make this work:

	- [Jeff Rowberg's digital motion processing program for MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050)
	- [My OpenGL C++ Library "GLider"](https://github.com/swarnavaghosh04/GLider)
	- [The ASIO Library (non boost) for reading COM Port](https://think-async.com/Asio/)
